## Introduction
This project was the second challenge we had at the Apple Developer Academy; where we were provided with high-fidelity prototypes of apps and were expected to develop them from scratch using Swift and SwiftUI. <br>
<br>
Hydrate is an intuitive iOS application designed to help users track their daily water intake based on their body weight and personal hydration goals. The application offers a user-friendly interface to record water consumption, set notifications, and visualize progress. It focuses on sending notifications that will consistently remind the user to continue working on their water intake goal. This project showcases two implementations: a traditional structure and an MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture.

## Technologies Used
- **SwiftUI**: The primary framework for building the user interface.
- **User Notifications**: For scheduling hydration reminders.
- **Xcode**: The integrated development environment (IDE) used for development.

## Features
- **Water Intake Tracking**: Users can input their body weight to calculate personalized water intake goals.
- **Notification Preferences**: Set start and end times for notifications to remind users to stay hydrated throughout the day.
- **Dynamic Progress Visualization**: A visual progress ring that reflects the user's water intake against their daily goal.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Smooth navigation and engaging design to enhance the user experience.
